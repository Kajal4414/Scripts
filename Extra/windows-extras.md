**1.** To delete the directory `C:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps` using a `.bat` script, you can use the following command:

```sh
rd "C:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps" /s /q
```

This command will delete the directory and all of its subdirectories and files. The `/s` flag tells the command to delete the subdirectories and files, and the `/q` flag tells it to run quietly without prompting for confirmation.

Here is an example `.bat` script that demonstrates how to use this command:

```sh
@echo off

rd "C:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps" /s /q

echo Directory deleted successfully.
```

Save this script with a `.bat` file extension, and then you can run it by double-clicking on the file.

If you are getting an `Access is denied` error when you try to delete the directory. This usually means that you do not have the necessary permissions to delete the directory.

1. Run the script as an administrator. Right-click on the `.bat` file and select `Run as administrator`.

2. Change the ownership of the directory to your user account. To do this, follow these steps:

- Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.
- Type the following command and press Enter:

```sh
:: This will give you ownership of the directory and all of its subdirectories and files.
takeown /F "%programfiles%\ModifiableWindowsApps" /R /D Y
```

- Type the following command and press Enter:

```sh
:: This will give full control permissions to the directory and all of its subdirectories and files.
icacls "%programfiles%\ModifiableWindowsApps" /grant administrators:F /T
```

Try running the delete script again after completing these steps.

```sh
rmdir /S /Q "%programfiles%\ModifiableWindowsApps"
```

**2.** This script delete the following directories:

```sh
rd /s %windir%\temp
rd /s %windir%\Prefetch
rd /s %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp
rd /s %userprofile%\Recent
rd /s %userprofile%\Searches
exit
```

The `%windir%` and `%userprofile%` variables are system variables that refer to the Windows directory and the current user's profile directory, respectively.

For example, if the Windows directory is `C:\Windows` and the current user's profile directory is `C:\Users\JohnDoe`, the script will delete the following directories:

> - C:\Windows\temp
> - C:\Windows\Prefetch
> - C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\Temp
> - C:\Users\JohnDoe\Recent
> - C:\Users\JohnDoe\Searches

The `rd` command stands for `remove directory`, and the `/s` flag tells the command to delete the directory and all of its subdirectories and files.
